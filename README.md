Kakuro is like a crossword puzzle with numbers. Each board's square must add up to the number provided in the clue above it or to the left. The board is filled with digits (from 1 to 9). The board's squares need to be filled in with these digits in order to sum up to the specified numbers. You are not allowed to use the same digit more than once to obtain a given sum. Every kakuro puzzle has one and only (unique) solution.

Kakuro puzzle grids an be any size, though usually the squares within them have to be arranged symmetrically. Kakuro puzzles will contain many clue squares, these are squares which help you to solve the puzzle. A clue square can have an "across" clue or a "down" clue, or both

However, a number of 7 over 3 squares has only 1 combination:
